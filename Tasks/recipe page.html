        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 and 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350째F (175째C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round baking pans.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed for about 2 minutes until the batter is smooth.</li>
            <li>Stir in the boiling water. The batter will be thin, but that's okay.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans.</li>
            <li>Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Then, remove them from the pans and place them on a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Once the cakes are completely cool, frost them with your favorite chocolate frosting.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy your delicious chocolate cake!</li>
