 <p><b>The Taj Mahal, an epitome of love and an architectural marvel, stands majestically on the banks of the<mark> Yamuna River in Agra</mark>, India.</b> Commissioned by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in 1632, the mausoleum was constructed in memory of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth. <i>The construction took over two decades to complete, involving the labor of approximately 20,000 artisans and craftsmen from across India, Persia, and the Ottoman Empire.</i> The monument is a quintessential example of Mughal architecture, a blend of Islamic, Persian, Ottoman Turkish, and Indian architectural styles, showcasing the cultural amalgamation and the artistic zenith of the Mughal era.
 <u>The central structure of the<small>Taj Mahal is made entirely of white marble,</small> which changes color depending on the time of day and the weather conditions.</u> At dawn, the monument glows with a soft pink hue, while under the midday sun, <q>it shines brilliant white, and in the evening, it reflects the golden hues of the setting sun.</q> intricate details of the marble inlay work, known as pietra dura, feature precious and semi-precious stones such as jade, crystal, lapis lazuli, amethyst, and turquoise, creating elaborate floral and geometric patterns. This level of craftsmanship not only exemplifies the skill of the artisans but also underscores the emperor's dedication to immortalizing his love.Surrounding the Taj Mahal is a sprawling Mughal garden, designed in the Persian style of a Charbagh, which is divided into four parts by raised pathways. Each quarter of the garden is further subdivided into smaller sections with carefully manicured lawns, flowerbeds, and rows of trees. The garden is laid out in such a way that it enhances the symmetry and balance of the entire complex. The reflection of the Taj Mahal in the long, rectangular pool at the center of the garden adds to the ethereal beauty of the site, making it a favorite spot for photographers and tourists alike. The garden's layout is symbolic of the Islamic concept of paradise, representing an eternal, harmonious place.The Taj Mahal complex also includes several other structures, each contributing to the overall grandeur of the site. To the west of the main mausoleum stands a mosque made of red sandstone, which is still used for prayer by the locals. To the east lies the Jawab, a building mirroring the mosque, maintaining the symmetry of the entire complex, though it serves no religious function. Additionally, the site is bordered by the Great Gate (Darwaza-i-Rauza), a monumental gateway made of red sandstone, which serves as the main entrance. This gateway is adorned with calligraphy of verses from the Quran, welcoming visitors and preparing them for the splendor that lies within.The Taj Mahal complex also includes several other structures, each contributing to the overall grandeur of the site.
